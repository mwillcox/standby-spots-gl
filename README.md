## Standby Spots with Mapbox GL JS

#### The app is viewable live [here](https://standby-spots-gl.netlify.com/).

Using multiple data sets from [https://data.sfgov.org/](https://data.sfgov.org/) this interactive Mapbox GL map displays location data for all of the public parks, parklets, and privately owned public open spaces in San Francisco.

Skills learned through this work:
- Creating valid GeoJSON files
- Using Mapbox GL maps, layers, clsuters, markers, and popups.

Features to add in the future:
- Better mobile experience
- Additional clustering styles
- List view with filters
- Additional data sources
- Public transportation routing
